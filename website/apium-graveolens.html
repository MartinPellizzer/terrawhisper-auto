<p>Celery (Apium graveolens) has long been used as a medicinal plant due to its numerous health benefits and medicinal properties. This herb helps alleviate various health conditions such as digestive issues, skin problems, respiratory issues, blood pressure, and kidney disorders. It also supports heart health, boosts immunity, reduces inflammation, and promotes weight loss.</p>
<p>The medicinal constituents of celery include flavonoids (luteolin and quercetin), polysaccharides (glucosides and rhamnosides), vitamins (A, C, K, B6), minerals (iron, magnesium, potassium), and enzymes (beta-sitosterol and celery steroids). These compounds work together to provide the health benefits of this herb.</p>
<p>The most commonly used parts of celery are its leaves, stems, and roots. The leaves are often used in teas or supplements, while the stems can be eaten raw or cooked like vegetables. Celery juice is also a popular medicinal preparation that is known for its numerous health benefits.</p>
<p>While celery is generally considered safe, it can cause adverse effects in some individuals. These include allergic reactions (itchy throat, sneezing), diarrhea, and gas when consumed in excess. Celery may also interact with blood-thinning medications such as warfarin. It is always advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using celery for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>To ensure the safety and efficacy of celery, it is important to follow certain precautions. Firstly, individuals with a history of allergies should avoid consuming celery or its products. Secondly, pregnant women should only use celery in moderation as there is limited research on its effects during pregnancy. Lastly, celery should be stored properly and consumed within a few days to ensure maximum potency.</p>
<h2>Cuisine</h2>

<p>Celery is a versatile vegetable that can be used in many dishes, from salads to soups. It is commonly used in cold cuts and sushi rolls. Celery is also a popular snack, often served with peanut butter or hummus dip. Its crunchy texture and slightly sweet taste make it a great addition to any dish.</p>
<p>Celery has a mild, slightly sweet flavor that pairs well with many other flavors. It is often used as a base for sauces, dressings, and marinades. The taste of celery can be enhanced by adding spices such as cumin, coriander, or mustard seeds. It also pairs well with acidic ingredients such as lemon juice or vinegar.</p>
<p>Celery is a low-calorie vegetable that is high in fiber and vitamins. The edible parts of celery include the stalks, leaves, and roots. The stalks are the most commonly used part of the vegetable, but the leaves and roots can also be eaten raw or cooked. Celery is often served as a snack or added to salads and soups.</p>
<p>When cooking with celery, it's important to note that it should be washed thoroughly before use. The leaves and roots should also be removed before cutting into pieces. Celery can be used raw or cooked, but it is best eaten within a few days of purchasing. It can also be stored in the fridge for up to a week.</p>
<p>While celery is generally safe to eat, it can cause side effects and toxicity in some cases. Consuming large amounts of celery can lead to celery poisoning, which can cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. In severe cases, it can also cause allergic reactions or anaphylaxis. It is also important to note that pregnant women and young children should avoid eating raw celery due to the risk of listeria infection.</p>
<h2>Horticulture</h2>
<p><img alt="horticulture" src="images/apium-graveolens-horticulture.jpg" title="horticulture" /></p>
<p>Celery is an annual horticultural crop that prefers loose, well-drained soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and 2 inches apart, spaced about 2 feet apart in rows. Thin to 18 inches between plants after germination. Mulch around the base of plants to conserve moisture and suppress weeds. Water thoroughly and regularly, especially during dry weather. Harvest when stalks are at least 20 inches tall.</p>
<p>Ideal growing conditions for celery include full sun exposure, high humidity, and moderate temperatures. Celery thrives in warm, moist environments with a temperature range of 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Avoid direct sunlight on the foliage during the hottest part of the day, as this can cause the leaves to wilt. Provide adequate air circulation by pruning away lower branches and tying up the main stalks.</p>
<p>Maintenance of celery involves regular watering, fertilizing, and weeding. Mulching is crucial in conserving moisture and suppressing weeds. Celery is susceptible to pests such as aphids, whiteflies, and slugs. Use insecticidal soap or neem oil to control these pests. Harvesting should be done carefully to avoid damaging the plants. Cut the stalks at the base using a sharp knife or scissors.</p>

<p>Celery (Apium graveolens) belongs to the domain Eukarya, kingdom Plantae, phylum Tracheophyta, class Magnoliopsida (Dicotyledons), order Apiales, family Apiaceae, genus Apium, and species graveolens. The plant is commonly known as celery or Chinese parsley.</p>
<p>Celery plants have a tall, slender stem that grows up to 2 meters in height. The leaves are compound, with three lobes, and are green in color. The plant produces small white flowers on the top of the stalk. The stem is thick and fibrous, making it difficult to chew without the use of teeth.</p>

<p>Celery, Apium graveolens, has a long history of traditional use in medicine. Its roots have been used for centuries to treat various ailments, including digestive issues and skin conditions.
