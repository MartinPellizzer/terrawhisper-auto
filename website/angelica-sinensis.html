<h2>Horticulture</h2>

<p>Growing dong quai (Angelica sinensis) requires a lot of care and attention to detail. This herb can only be grown from seed, which must be collected after ripening on the plant. Once sown, dong quai needs full sun exposure and well-drained soil. It prefers slightly acidic soil with a pH level between 6.0 and 6.5. After about two weeks of germination, the seedlings should be thinned to give them enough space to grow. As they get larger, provide them with support to prevent them from falling over. The leaves are typically green and glossy, while the stems are thin and flexible. Dong quai is a hardy plant that can tolerate cold temperatures, but it requires moderate watering to keep it hydrated.</p>
<p>The ideal growing conditions for dong quai (Angelica sinensis) depend on its age and size. Young plants need more attention than mature ones, as they require frequent fertilization and pruning to promote healthy growth. The soil should be moist during spring and summer, but dry in the winter months to prevent mold and rot. Dong quai is a shade-tolerant plant, so it can be grown in areas with partial or full shade. To keep the plant healthy, remove any dead leaves or debris from the base of the stem. Prune back the branches regularly to promote bushy growth and prevent them from becoming too heavy for the stem to support. If dong quai starts to wilt or turn brown, it may be a sign of stress, which could be caused by overwatering or lack of sunlight.</p>
<p>Maintaining dong quai (Angelica sinensis) is relatively easy once it has established itself in its growing environment. The plant does not require frequent watering, but it should be kept moist during dry periods to prevent wilting. Dong quai requires minimal pruning, as the branches will naturally grow outward and upward to reach for sunlight. To prevent pests and diseases from affecting the plant, apply a natural fungicide or insecticide on a regular basis. If the leaves start to yellow or brown, it may be a sign of nutrient deficiency, which can be remedied by adding organic matter to the soil or fertilizing with a balanced fertilizer. Overall, dong quai is a low-maintenance plant that requires little attention beyond basic care and monitoring.</p>
