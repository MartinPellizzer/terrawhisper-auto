It was believed to have calming and soothing effects on the nervous system, making it a popular remedy for anxiety, stress, and other mental health conditions. In ancient Greece, sweet flag was used to treat epilepsy and headaches. The plant was also thought to help with digestion, particularly when used as an infusion or tea.

 Sweet flag played an important role in divination, particularly among the Celts. It was believed that by using the plant's aromatic oil, one could communicate with the spirits and gain insight into the future. The plant was often placed on altars or used during rituals to help facilitate communication with the gods. Today, sweet flag is still considered an important herb in many spiritual practices.

 There are several legends surrounding sweet flag. One popular legend tells of a young girl who was lost in the woods and stumbled upon a small cottage. The kind old woman who lived there offered her some tea made from sweet flag, which soon put the girl to sleep. When she woke up, she found herself back at home, safe and sound. From that day on, sweet flag became a powerful symbol of protection and guidance for those in need.
