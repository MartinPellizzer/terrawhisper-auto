 There are two main variants of sweet flag, which are the broad-leaved and narrow-leaved varieties. The broad-leaved variety has wider leaves with a longer petiole than the narrow-leaved variety. Additionally, the broad-leaved variety tends to have more robust stems and larger flowers than the narrow-leaved variety.

 Sweet flag is native to wetlands and streamsides of North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. It prefers moist soils and can tolerate full sun or partial shade. In addition, the plant is also found in aquatic habitats such as marshes, swamps, and rivers.

 Sweet flag has a diploid life cycle with a sporophyte phase that produces seeds. The seeds are dispersed by water and animals, which consume the fruit and excrete the seeds in their feces. The plant also has an antheridium phase that produces pollen, which is fertilized by pollen from another flower to produce seeds.
