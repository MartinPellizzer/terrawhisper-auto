Sweet flag (Acorus calamus) is a hardy perennial that prefers moist soil and full sun. To grow this plant, start by preparing a well-draining soil mix of peat moss, perlite, and vermiculite. Mix in some compost or well-rotted manure to provide nutrients. Plant the rhizomes about 2 inches deep and spaced about 18 inches apart. Water the area thoroughly and keep the soil moist during germination, which usually takes 7-10 days. Once established, sweet flag can tolerate some shade but prefers full sun. It grows to a height of 3-4 feet and has feathery foliage that is green in summer and turns yellow in fall.

Ideal growing conditions for sweet flag include moist soil that is well-drained, full sun exposure, and a temperature range of 60-75°F (15-24°C). The plant prefers slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH of 6.0-7.5. It also requires good drainage to prevent root rot. Sweet flag is drought-tolerant but needs regular watering during dry spells.

Maintenance of sweet flag involves removing any dead leaves or debris and pruning back the foliage in late summer or early fall to encourage new growth the following year. The plant also benefits from being divided every 2-3 years to prevent overcrowding and promote healthy growth. In addition, sweet flag can be harvested for its medicinal properties, with the rhizomes being used to make tea or tinctures. Regular inspection is important to ensure the absence of pests or diseases that could harm the plant.
