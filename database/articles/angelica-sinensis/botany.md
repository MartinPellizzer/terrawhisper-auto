Common names include dong quai (Vietnamese), yu chu qui (Cambodian), and angelica root (English).

 Dong quai is a perennial herb that grows up to 1 meter tall with a thick, fleshy stem. The leaves are dark green, lance-shaped, and glossy. The plant bears clusters of small, white flowers on erect stems. The fruit is an orange-red berry that contains several seeds.

 There are no significant variants of dong quai. However, there are different cultivars of the plant with varying leaf sizes and colors.

 Dong quai is native to China, Korea, Japan, and Russia. It is widely cultivated in East Asia for its medicinal properties.

 Dong quai has a diploid life cycle, meaning it has two sets of chromosomes. The plant reproduces via seeds that are dispersed by birds and other animals. The seeds germinate and grow into new plants, which continue the life cycle.
