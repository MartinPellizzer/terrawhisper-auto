 Garlic is a hardy perennial that grows best in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. To grow garlic, start by planting cloves in early fall or late winter. Each clove should be about an inch deep and spaced about six inches apart. Cover the cloves with soil and water them thoroughly. Once the soil has dried out, cover the bed with a layer of straw or leaves to insulate it from the cold. In spring, garlic will sprout green shoots that will eventually grow into mature bulbs. These bulbs can be harvested in late summer or early fall when they are large and their skins are firm.

 Garlic thrives in a variety of climates but prefers cooler temperatures. The ideal growing conditions for garlic include well-drained soil with a pH level of 6.0-7.0, full sun exposure, and moderate watering. Garlic requires about one inch of water per week during the growing season, but should be kept dry during the dormant period. To ensure optimal growth, garlic should be fertilized with an organic fertilizer once a month.

 Maintenance is relatively simple for garlic. Once harvested, bulbs can be stored in a cool, dark place for several months. To extend their shelf life, simply tie the stalks together and hang them upside down. Garlic should not be refrigerated as it will sprout and turn green. If the bulb starts to sprout, simply cut off the green shoots with scissors or a knife. To prevent garlic from becoming bitter, do not let it dry out completely before storing. Instead, store it in a cool, dark place with good air circulation.
