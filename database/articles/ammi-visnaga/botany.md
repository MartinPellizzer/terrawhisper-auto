Visnaga (Ammi visnaga) is a member of the plant kingdom, belonging to the phylum Tracheophyta and the class Magnoliopsida. The order Amaranthales includes families such as Chenopodiaceae, Amaranthaceae, and Araliaceae. Visnaga belongs to the family Apiaceae, which contains various other plants like carrots, parsnips, and dill.

The genus Ammi has five species including A. visnaga, A. ammifolia, A. maritima, A. glandulosa, and A. cina. A. visnaga is commonly known as the "Queen of the Fields" or "Royal Carrot" in some regions.

Visnaga has a biennial life cycle, with seeds germinating in spring and plants growing to maturity in two years. The plant grows up to 1.5 meters tall and has a distinctive appearance with a smooth, hairless stem, branching leaves, and small, white flowers.

The variants of visnaga include A. ammifolia and A. maritima. A. ammifolia is commonly known as the "Mediterranean Carrot" or "Sea Bean," while A. maritima is known as the "Saltwater Carrot." The differences between these variants are mainly in their geographic distribution and natural habitats.

Visnaga is native to southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia, but it has been widely cultivated and spread throughout the world. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure, growing best in temperate and subtropical regions.

The botanical aspect of visnaga involves various biological processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, reproduction, and growth. Visnaga has a unique ability to store water in its roots, which allows it to survive in arid environments. Its seeds are also adapted for long-distance dispersal by birds and other animals.

Visnaga is an important crop plant, used primarily for its root vegetables. The root system of visnaga is highly developed, with a large taproot that can grow up to 2 meters deep and 0.5 meters wide. This extensive root system allows the plant to access nutrients and water from deep within the soil.

The morphology of visnaga includes various structures such as leaves, stems, roots, flowers, and seeds. The leaves are simple, with a lobed margin, while the stem is smooth, hairless, and elongated. The flowers are small, white, and have five petals arranged in a star shape.

The variants of visnaga differ mainly in their geographic distribution and natural habitats. A. ammifolia is found along the Mediterranean coast and is adapted to salt-tolerant environments, while A. maritima is found in coastal regions and is adapted to saltwater environments. Both variants have similar morphology and growth patterns.

Overall, visnaga is a highly versatile plant with various biological processes that enable it to grow and thrive in different environments. Its importance as a crop plant cannot be overstated, as it provides a valuable source of food and medicine for millions of people worldwide.
