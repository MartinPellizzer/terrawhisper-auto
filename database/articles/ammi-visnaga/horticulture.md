 Visnaga is a relatively easy-to-grow perennial, which means it returns every year. It prefers full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil. To grow visnaga, start by planting seeds about 2 cm deep and 30 cm apart in early spring or fall. Thin the seedlings to 15-20 cm apart when they are 4 inches tall. Keep the soil moist during germination and water regularly once established. Prune the plant back to the base every three years to encourage new growth.

 Visnaga thrives in a variety of growing conditions, but it prefers warm, well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. It is a hardy plant that can tolerate both hot and cold temperatures, making it suitable for gardens in many regions. The ideal growing conditions include temperatures between 20째C - 30째C (68째F - 86째F) and full sun exposure. Visnaga also requires good drainage to prevent root rot.

 Visnaga is a low-maintenance plant that doesn't require much attention once established. However, it does benefit from regular pruning to maintain its shape and size. Prune back the plant to the base every three years to encourage new growth. In addition, remove any dead or dying branches throughout the year. Visnaga also benefits from fertilization in early spring to promote healthy growth. Use a balanced fertilizer, following the package instructions for application rates.
