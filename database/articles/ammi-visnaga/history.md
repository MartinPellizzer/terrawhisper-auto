 Visnaga has been used in traditional medicine for thousands of years. It contains bitter-succus and is believed to have anti-inflammatory properties, making it effective in treating a variety of ailments including joint pain, skin conditions, and digestive issues. The leaves were often chewed or ground into a paste and applied topically to soothe irritation and reduce inflammation.

 In divination, visnaga was used as a tool for communication with the dead and to gain insight into the future. It was believed that the plant had the ability to communicate with the spirits of the deceased and could be used to guide those who were lost or in need of guidance. The leaves were often used to create divination tools such as dream catchers, which were hung above the bed to capture dreams and provide insight into the future.

 There are many legends surrounding visnaga, including one about a young woman who was lost in the forest. She stumbled upon a grove of visnaga trees and began to pick the leaves, feeling as though she was being guided by the spirits of the deceased. As she continued to pick the leaves, she suddenly felt a sense of peace and clarity wash over her, and she knew that she had found the way back home. From that day on, she carried a small bundle of visnaga leaves with her wherever she went, as a reminder of the guidance she had received from the spirits.
