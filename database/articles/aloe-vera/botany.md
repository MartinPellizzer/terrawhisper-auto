Aloe vera is a member of the Plantae domain, Kingdom Plantae, Phylum Tracheophyta, Class Magnoliopsida, Order Laminales, Family Aloaceae, Genus Aloe, and Species vera. The common names for Aloe vera include aloe, aloe plant, succulent, aloe barbadensis, and African aloe.

Aloe vera is a succulent plant with thick, fleshy leaves that are arranged in rosettes. The leaves are lance-shaped and have small spines along their edges. Aloe vera grows to a height of 1-2 feet and can spread over an area of 3-4 feet. It has large flowers that are red or pink with white centers, which bloom on spikes that rise above the foliage.

There are several variants of Aloe vera, including Aloe vera var. alba (white aloe), Aloe vera var. aurita (pink aloe), and Aloe vera var. buchii (buchii aloe). These variants differ in their leaf color and shape. White aloe has white leaves with pinkish tips, while pink aloe has pink leaves with a slightly curved shape. Buchii aloe has long, thin leaves that resemble those of agave plants.

Aloe vera is native to Africa and is found in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, savannas, and deserts. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Aloe vera is also commonly grown as an ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes due to its attractive foliage and easy care requirements.

Aloe vera has a simple life cycle that includes vegetative growth, flowering, and seed production. Vegetative growth occurs when the plant produces new leaves and stems from its base. Flowering occurs on spikes that rise above the foliage, and the plant produces seeds that are dispersed by wind or animals. Aloe vera is a perennial plant, meaning it can live for several years and produce new growth each year.
