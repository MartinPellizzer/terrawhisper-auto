Traditional medicine has long recognized aloe vera for its healing properties. The plant was used by ancient Egyptians to treat a variety of ailments, including digestive problems, skin conditions, and even wounds. In traditional African medicine, aloe vera is believed to have anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving effects, making it a popular remedy for arthritis and other joint disorders. Today, aloe vera is still used in alternative medicine as a natural remedy for digestive issues, such as irritable bowel syndrome, and as a topical treatment for psoriasis and other skin conditions.

In divination practices, the plant is used to seek guidance from the gods. The leaves are burned to create smoke, which is then inhaled or used in offerings to the deities. In some cultures, aloe vera is also believed to have spiritual healing properties and is used in rituals to cleanse the soul of negative energy.

Legend has it that aloe vera was created by the gods themselves. According to one story, the goddess Nut saw the sun setting on the horizon and wept tears of gold, which fell to earth and created the plant. Another legend tells of a great flood that destroyed the earth, and only the aloe vera plant survived, providing hope and healing to all who discovered it. In some cultures, the plant is also believed to be inhabited by spirits or other supernatural beings, and is treated with great reverence and respect.
