Horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) contains several key constituents, including scopolamine, quercetin, betulinic acid, aesculitrin b, theaflavins, catechins, kaempferol, esculetin, gallic acid, and ursolic acid. Scopolamine is an alkaloid that can cause dizziness and visual distortions in high doses. Quercetin is a flavonoid that has antioxidant properties and may help reduce inflammation. Betulinic acid is a triterpene that has anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antimicrobial effects. Aesculitrin b is another triterpene that can increase blood flow and improve circulation. Theaflavins are flavonoids that may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Catechins are flavonoids that are found in tea and may help reduce inflammation and prevent oxidative stress. Kaempferol is a flavonoid that has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
