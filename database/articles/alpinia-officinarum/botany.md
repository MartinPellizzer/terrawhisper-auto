The botanical name for galangal is Alpinia officinarum. It belongs to the kingdom Plantae, phylum Tracheophyta, class Magnoliopsida, order Zingiberales, family Zingiberaceae, genus Alpinia, and species officinarum. The common names include ginger, Chinese ginger, galangal root, and knotted ginger.

Galangal is a perennial herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall. It has fleshy rhizomes that grow underground and produce thick, tubular stems that branch into a rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The leaves are dark green with purple veins, and the flowers are yellow and occur on a spadix that is surrounded by bracts. Galangal has a distinctive aroma and taste due to its high content of volatile oils, including galangol and shogaol.

There are several variants of galangal, including Alpinia galanga, Alpinia tenuissima, and Alpinia pumila. These variants differ in their morphology, with A. galanga having long, thin rhizomes and a more elongated stem, A. tenuissima having thin, delicate leaves, and A. pumila having smaller, more compact plants.

Galangal is native to Southeast Asia, where it is widely used in traditional medicine and cuisine. It is also cultivated in other parts of the world, including India, China, Japan, and the United States. Galangal thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil.

Galangal has a typical biennial life cycle, with flowering occurring after two years of growth. The plant produces a large number of seeds that are dispersed by birds and other animals. The seeds germinate in the soil and develop into small shoots that grow up to form the mature plant. Galangal is a self-pollinating plant, with the flowers producing pollen that fertilizes the ovules on the same or neighboring plants.
