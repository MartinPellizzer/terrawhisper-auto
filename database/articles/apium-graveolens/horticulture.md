Celery is an annual horticultural crop that prefers loose, well-drained soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. Plant seeds 1/4 inch deep and 2 inches apart, spaced about 2 feet apart in rows. Thin to 18 inches between plants after germination. Mulch around the base of plants to conserve moisture and suppress weeds. Water thoroughly and regularly, especially during dry weather. Harvest when stalks are at least 20 inches tall.

Ideal growing conditions for celery include full sun exposure, high humidity, and moderate temperatures. Celery thrives in warm, moist environments with a temperature range of 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Avoid direct sunlight on the foliage during the hottest part of the day, as this can cause the leaves to wilt. Provide adequate air circulation by pruning away lower branches and tying up the main stalks.

Maintenance of celery involves regular watering, fertilizing, and weeding. Mulching is crucial in conserving moisture and suppressing weeds. Celery is susceptible to pests such as aphids, whiteflies, and slugs. Use insecticidal soap or neem oil to control these pests. Harvesting should be done carefully to avoid damaging the plants. Cut the stalks at the base using a sharp knife or scissors.
