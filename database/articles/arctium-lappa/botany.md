 Burdock (Arctium lappa) belongs to the kingdom Plantae, phylum Tracheophyta, class Magnoliopsida, order Asterales, family Asteraceae, genus Arctium, and species lappa. It is commonly known as gobo, wild burdock, or wild gobe.

 Burdock variants include gobo (Arctium edule), Chinese gobo (Arctium thalassioides), and Japanese gobo (Arctium imatum). Gobo is cultivated for its edible root, while Chinese and Japanese gobo are wild plants that are not typically consumed.

 Burdock plants grow up to 1 meter tall and have large, lobed leaves with serrated margins. The flowers are bright yellow and form in clusters on a tall stem. The fruit is a burr, which contains the seeds, and can be used for food or as a natural remedy for skin conditions.

 Burdock plants are native to Asia, specifically Japan, China, and Korea. They are found in wetlands, fields, and forests and thrive in cool, moist environments.

 The life cycle of burdock begins with the seed, which germinates after a period of cold stratification. The plant grows rapidly and produces flowers within a few months. After pollination, the fruit forms on the stem and matures in about two months. The seeds are dispersed by wind and can germinate in new locations.
