Burdock (Arctium lappa) is a hardy perennial herb that grows to a height of 1-2 meters. It has large, lobed leaves and produces small, white flowers on long stalks. Burdock can be grown from seed or by dividing the root system in late spring or early summer. To grow burdock, prepare the soil by adding compost or well-rotted manure. Plant the seeds 1-2 cm deep and spaced 30-45 cm apart. Thin the seedlings to 15-20 cm apart when they are 10-15 cm tall. Burdock prefers full sun but can tolerate partial shade. It requires well-drained soil with a pH of 6.0-7.5. Water burdock regularly during dry spells, especially in early spring and fall.

Burdock grows best in full sun with well-drained soil that is slightly acidic to neutral. It prefers moist, well-draining soil that is rich in organic matter. Burdock requires a lot of space, so it's important to plant it in an area where it can grow without interfering with other plants. Burdock also requires regular watering during dry spells, especially in early spring and fall. It's a good idea to fertilize burdock regularly to keep it healthy and productive. Use a balanced fertilizer formulated for perennials or add compost or well-rotted manure to the soil every 6-8 weeks.

Burdock requires minimal maintenance once established. It does not require pruning unless the roots are becoming too crowded, in which case they can be carefully separated and replanted. Burdock also does not require fertilizer during the growing season. However, it will benefit from regular watering during dry spells. In late summer or fall, cut back the stalks to the base of the plant to encourage new growth for the following year.
