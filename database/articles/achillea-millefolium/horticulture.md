 Growing Yarrow (Achillea millefolium) is relatively easy, thanks to its ability to thrive in a variety of conditions. To grow yarrow, start by choosing a location with well-draining soil that receives at least six hours of sunlight per day. Plant the seeds or seedlings about 12 inches apart and cover them with a thin layer of soil. Water the plants regularly during the first few weeks after planting to keep the soil moist. Once established, yarrow is drought tolerant and requires minimal watering. To keep your plants healthy and attractive, fertilize them once or twice a year with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer.

 Yarrow prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. It is drought tolerant and can thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy, loamy, and clay soils. The plant grows best when the soil is slightly acidic, with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Yarrow requires regular watering during dry periods, but it is also tolerant of periods of drought. To keep your plants healthy, you should remove any dead or diseased leaves and stems as soon as possible.
