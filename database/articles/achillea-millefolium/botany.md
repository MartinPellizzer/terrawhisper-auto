 Yarrow (Achillea millefolium) is a flowering plant that belongs to the domain Eukarya, kingdom Plantae, phylum Magnoliophyta, class Liliopsida, order Asterales, family Asteraceae, genus Achillea, and species millefolium. The common names for yarrow include Milkweed, Nettle-leaved yarrow, Wild yarrow, Mountain yarrow, Groundsel, Common yarrow, English yarrow, and Cow parsley.


 Yarrow is a perennial herbaceous plant that grows to a height of 30-60 cm and has a rosette of foliage. The leaves are lanceolate, with serrated or lobed edges, and are arranged in an alternate pattern. The flowers are borne on tall stalks and have ray florets that are white or pink, with yellow or red centers.

 There are several variants of yarrow, including the smooth-leafed yarrow (Achillea millefolium var. nodosa), the lobed-leafed yarrow (Achillea millefolium var. cervicornis), and the hairy-stemmed yarrow (Achillea millefolium var. hispanica). Smooth-leafed yarrow has round or oval leaves with smooth edges, while lobed-leafed yarrow has deeply lobed leaves. Hairy-stemmed yarrow has hairy stems and leaves.

 Yarrow is native to Europe, Asia, and North America, and is widely distributed throughout the world. It grows in fields, meadows, and woodlands, and can also be found along roadsides and in urban areas. Yarrow prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure, but can tolerate partial shade and moist conditions.

 The life cycle of yarrow is biennial, meaning it completes two growth cycles in two years. In the first year, the plant produces a rosette of leaves, which die back over winter. In the second year, a new rosette of leaves grows and flowers are produced on a stalk that arises from the center of the rosette. The seeds are then dispersed by wind or animals.
