Yarrow (Achillea millefolium) has numerous medicinal properties that have been known since ancient times. It is commonly used in both traditional and modern medicine to treat various health conditions. Some of the major medicinal benefits of yarrow include its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antispasmodic properties. Yarrow is also believed to be effective in treating digestive issues such as diarrhea, dysentery, and stomach ulcers. Additionally, it has been found to have analgesic properties that can help relieve pain from headaches, toothaches, and menstrual cramps.



The medicinal constituents of yarrow include flavonoids, polysaccharides, and essential oils. The main flavonoid found in yarrow is apigenin, which has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties. Other flavonoids found in yarrow include quercetin and kaempferol, both of which have antioxidant properties. Yarrow also contains polysaccharides, such as arabinans and xanthans, which are believed to have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Additionally, yarrow is a rich source of essential oils, including citronellol, geraniol, and limonene, which have been shown to have analgesic properties.



The most commonly used parts of yarrow in medicine are the leaves and flower heads. These parts can be consumed raw or dried and used to make teas, tinctures, or decoctions. Yarrow is also available in supplement form as a powder or capsule. The most common medicinal preparation of yarrow is the tea, which can be consumed daily for up to 14 days. Additionally, yarrow is commonly used topically as a poultice or ointment to treat skin conditions such as acne, eczema, and psoriasis.



While yarrow is generally considered safe for most people, it can cause side effects in some individuals. These side effects may include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea when consumed orally. Topical use of yarrow may also cause skin irritation, redness, and itching. Additionally, pregnant women should avoid consuming yarrow as it may increase the risk of miscarriage.



Yarrow should be used with caution in individuals who are allergic to pollen or other plant parts. It is also important to consult a healthcare professional before using yarrow if you have a medical condition, are taking medication, or are pregnant or breastfeeding. Additionally, it is recommended to use yarrow only as a supportive supplement and not as a substitute for conventional medical treatment.
